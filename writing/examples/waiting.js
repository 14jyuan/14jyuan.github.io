// This story was selected for Curveship-js adaptation in part because the
// narrator (the “I” of the story, the drug purchaser) shifts to become the
// narratee (the “you”). While this mid-narrative shift cannot be accomplished
// in Curveship-js 0.2, it will be interesting to try to implement it. This
// selection also means that a narrative from a popular song is represented
// among the examples.
